# Welcome to my first website!

This project was created for an imaginary after-school childcare service.

## User Experience (UX)

The primary Project Goal is to create a marketing website for 'ActiveKids After-school club'.
The target audience are working parents who are looking for flexible after-school childcare arrangements that support parents' busy lifestyle and provide excellent after school care for children.

### Design choices

* Colour Scheme
The three main colours used are orange, teal and shade of gray. I find that these colours complement each other and are pleasing to the eye.

* Typography
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website. Roboto was chosen for its friendly features.
Merienda font is ideal for headlines.
